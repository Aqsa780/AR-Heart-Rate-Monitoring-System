The Augmented Reality (AR) Heart Rate Monitoring System combines sensor-based health monitoring with AR technology to provide an interactive and intuitive visualization of heart activity. The system consists of a pulse sensor (e.g., MAX30100) connected to an Arduino microcontroller, which processes pulse data and calculates Beats Per Minute (BPM). This data is transmitted wirelessly to a Unity-based AR application via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. The Unity application renders a realistic 3D heart model that pulsates in real-time, synchronized with the userâ€™s heartbeat, providing a visual representation of heart rate.
The AR environment enhances user engagement by offering color-coded feedback to indicate heart rate zones, such as normal, elevated, or critical levels, and allows interaction for viewing historical data or health warnings. Developed using C++ for hardware programming and C# for Unity scripting, the system is designed for applications in healthcare, fitness, and education. It provides real-time monitoring, with smooth integration between hardware and software for minimal latency. Challenges such as noise in sensor data and synchronization lag are addressed through filtering techniques and optimized rendering. 
Future enhancements include integration with wearable devices, advanced data analytics, and extended AR functionalities for better diagnostics. The AR Heart Rate Monitoring System is a versatile tool for continuous heart health monitoring, offering a novel approach to visualize cardiovascular health, improve fitness tracking, and aid in medical education, making it an innovative solution in the intersection of technology and healthcare.# AR-Heart-Rate-Monitoring-System
